# The Chenilles Network

In [our whitepaper](whitepaper.md),
we presents the overall vision for the *Chenilles* Network,
how it can solve the issues that currently prevent cryptocurrencies
from “going to the moon”,
what are the capabilities and limits of its Generalized State Channels
compared to other decentralized solutions,
the new applications enabled by the network,
and what business model can sustain its development and operation.

In [our concepts](concepts.md) document we explain how State Channels work,
and expound the main underlying technical concepts,
as well as provide a bit of historical information.

In [our roadmap](roadmap.md) we explain our detailed plan
to build and market the *Chenilles* Network,
the intermediate milestones along the way,
and the new applications enabled by each milestone.
