new payment network that can transmit value across blockchains and currencies,
safely, at scale, with a direct connection to on-ramp and off-ramp solutions.
<em>Chenilles</em> will remove the main hurdles that prevent cryptocurrencies
from “going to the Moon”: scalability, safety and usability.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://lightning.network/">Bitcoin Lightning Network</a>,
<em>Chenilles</em> enables fast and private <em>self-custodial</em> payments
along paths in a network of state channels.
But improving on these first generation state channels,
<em>Chenilles</em> enables both payments across multiple blockchains,
and private smart contracts in addition to private payments, in synergy with
our existing <a href="https://glow-lang.org"><em>Glow</em> language</a> for safe DApps.</p><p>Previous solutions for programming generalized state channels
required unmanageable complexity:
hand-writing many exactly matching variants of on-chain and off-chain code
for each smart contract, where the slightest discrepancy
could result in losing funds.
The <em>Glow</em> language makes the task manageable: <em>Glow</em> automates the generation
of the many exactly matching variants of on-chain and off-chain code
involved in such smart contracts, across multiple blockchains if needed.
<em>Glow</em> can target public or private contracts, with or without state channels,
with or without zk-SNARKs, on any smart contract platform
(Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cardano, Filecoin, etc.), and is also designed around
formal methods to make correctness proofs tractable.</p><p>Together, <em>Chenilles</em> and <em>Glow</em> will unlock a new world of
private, scalable and safe self-custodial decentralized commerce and finance,
eventually spanning all blockchains.
Users will be able to perform atomic swaps of exotic financial instruments
between two side-chains, to participate in auctions on the Ethereum network
while paying in Bitcoin on the Lightning Network, or to fill the orders
of decentralized exchanges without funds leaving self-custody.</p><p><a href="https://chenilles.network">Chenilles, LLC</a>
is developing <em>Chenilles</em> and <em>Glow</em> as Open Source platforms,
with an ambitious business model to become the company that
connects all decentralized applications together.</p><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#abstract">Abstract</a><ul><li><a href="#table-of-contents">Table of Contents</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#motivation:-unlocking-cross-chain-defi-&amp;-deco">Motivation: Unlocking Cross-Chain DeFi &amp; DeCo</a><ul><li><a href="#cryptocurrencies-and-their-promise">Cryptocurrencies and their Promise</a></li><li><a href="#current-limitations-of-cryptocurrencies">Current Limitations of Cryptocurrencies</a></li><li><a href="#*chenilles*,-an-overlay-network-to-solve-issues-with-current-networks"><em>Chenilles</em>, an Overlay Network to Solve Issues with Current Networks</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#existing-issues-with-decentralized-networks">Existing Issues with Decentralized Networks</a><ul><li><a href="#layer-1-blockchains">Layer 1 Blockchains</a></li><li><a href="#layer-2-side-chains">Layer 2 Side-Chains</a></li><li><a href="#layer-2-state-channels">Layer 2 State Channels</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#*chenilles*:-next-generation-state-channels-with-unique-capabilities"><em>Chenilles</em>: Next Generation State Channels with Unique Capabilities</a><ul><li><a href="#smart-contracts-using-*glow*">Smart Contracts using <em>Glow</em></a></li><li><a href="#multi-token">Multi-Token</a></li><li><a href="#multi-chain">Multi-Chain</a></li><li><a href="#multi-participant">Multi-Participant</a></li><li><a href="#improved-privacy-with-hidden-channels">Improved Privacy with Hidden Channels</a></li><li><a href="#further-improved-privacy-with-zk-snarks">Further Improved Privacy with zk-SNARKs</a></li><li><a href="#nestability">Nestability</a></li><li><a href="#advanced-smart-contracts">Advanced Smart Contracts</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#applications-enabled-by-*chenilles*">Applications enabled by <em>Chenilles</em></a><ul><li><a href="#payments-with-automatic-currency-conversion">Payments with automatic currency conversion</a></li><li><a href="#micropayments-for-metered-decentralized-utilities">Micropayments for metered decentralized utilities</a></li><li><a href="#decentralized-banking">Decentralized Banking</a></li><li><a href="#private-smart-contracts">Private Smart Contracts</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#business-model-for-chenilles-llc">Business Model For Chenilles LLC</a><ul><li><a href="#big-picture:-a-layer-above-blockchains">Big Picture: A layer above blockchains</a></li><li><a href="#fees-on-channel-creation">Fees on Channel Creation</a></li><li><a href="#commissions-on-network-payments">Commissions on Network Payments</a></li><li><a href="#issuing-value-add-tokens">Issuing Value Add Tokens</a></li><li><a href="#controlling-the-default-client">Controlling the Default Client</a></li><li><a href="#decentralized-application-development">Decentralized Application Development</a></li><li><a href="#steering-an-ecosystem">Steering an Ecosystem</a></li><li><a href="#bootstrapping-the-business">Bootstrapping the Business</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#conclusion:-invest-in-the-future-of-defi-and-deco">Conclusion: Invest in the Future of DeFi and DeCo</a></li><li><a href="#references-and-bibliography">References and Bibliography</a></li></ul><h2>Motivation: Unlocking Cross-Chain DeFi &amp; DeCo</h2><h3>Cryptocurrencies and their Promise</h3><p>Cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Ledgers,
as introduced with the Bitcoin blockchain by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009,
offer a potential solution to the problem of
runaway inflation of the money supply by government-mandated central banks—a
problem that has already hit “first world” countries
such as Cyprus in the Eurozone, and
is now looming over the USA as well as all of Europe.
Smart Contracts, introduced with Ethereum in 2015,
enabled the creation of Decentralized Finance (DeFi),
a way to reproduce traditional finance and more on top of blockchains,
without centralized middlemen capable of
censoring political opponents, freezing or confiscating their funds, etc.,
for authoritarian governments—a
problem also recently experienced even in Canada, a “Western Democracy”,
and that only seems to get worse everywhere.</p><p>The full potential of decentralization technology will only be realized
when every human (and soon, AI) can use it daily as a way to conduct commerce
without all the current centralized middlemen,
in a way that can embrace and extend legacy systems rather than exist apart.
The value of cryptocurrencies is backed by their expected probability
of realizing this potential, an event also known as their “going to the Moon”,
when they fully replace the government-monopoly “fiat” currencies
that dominate today.</p><h3>Current Limitations of Cryptocurrencies</h3><p>But the advent of this Decentralized Commerce (DeCo) will require
some fundamental innovations to improve
the scalability, safety, and usability of blockchains and DeFi:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lack of Scalability</strong>:
Current blockchains offer limited transaction volumes
that could not presently satisfy the demands of the world population.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lack of Safety</strong>:
Using blockchain technology is difficult and unforgiving,
with potential unrecoverable loss of funds in case
of mistake by users or developers, or of successful attack by criminals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lack of Usability</strong>:
Blockchains form a constellation of isolated ecosystems
that do not interoperate with each other,
much less with the dominant ecosystem of “fiat” currencies,
except by going through a few centralized or semi-centralized
“exchanges” and “bridges” that often get attacked by criminals,
private or government-backed.</p></li></ul><p>For these reasons, blockchain technology today is only available
to professionals and to enthusiastic amateurs
with enough time, skills or capital to be early adopters
despite all the difficulties.</p><h3><em>Chenilles</em>, an Overlay Network to Solve Issues with Current Networks</h3><p>We at <em>Chenilles</em> LLC propose the <em>Chenilles</em> Network,
a next-generation State Channel Network that solves the above issues
and can unblock cryptocurrencies from going to the Moon.</p><p>Like existing State Channel networks,
<em>Chenilles</em> is a “Layer 2” (L2) on top of existing “Layer 1” (L1) blockchains.
But unlike these existing networks, <em>Chenilles</em> can simultaneously exist
on all blockchains and connect them all together, with or without bridges.
<em>Chenilles</em> will thus constitute an overlay L2 network
above all the L1 networks.</p><p>Existing State Channel networks only help
with scaling payments within one blockchain
(and possibly its bridged extensions to other blockchains and side-chains);
but <em>Chenilles</em>, thanks to its synergy with our language <em>Glow</em>,
can also help scale smart contracts in addition to payments, and
do so across multiple Blockchains rather than just within one blockchain;
it can even work without having to trust a third-party bridge,
though it can also take advantage of bridges for higher efficiency,
when trusted by both participants.</p><p><em>Chenilles</em> will become a key platform to enable usable DeFi and DeCo at scale
across all blockchains.</p><h2>Existing Issues with Decentralized Networks</h2><p>This section explains the advantages and limitations
of existing blockchain networks.
You can skip to the next section
[<em>Chenilles</em>: Next Generation State Channels with Unique Capabilities](#Chenilles: Next Generation State Channels with Unique Capabilities)
if you are already familiar with them.</p><h3>Layer 1 Blockchains</h3><p>The main “Layer 1” (L1) Blockchains
(such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano or Filecoin)
create decentralized currencies that can be used for
safe censorship-resistant payments between participants
without third party risk.
They provide:</p><ul><li><strong>Security</strong>: It would take a huge amount of capital to disrupt the network,
at which point this capital becomes wasted.</li></ul><p>BUT</p><ul><li><strong>Little Scalability</strong>: L1s don’t scale—for important security reasons.
A blockchain can only have
as many transactions as all the validators can see,
only as fast as they can all know they all saw.</li></ul><h3>Layer 2 Side-Chains</h3><p>Some “Layer 2” (L2) side-chains (such as Polygon, Optimism or Metis) provide:</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Scalability</strong>: L2 side-chains can increase scalability,
though each side-chain can only increase it so much,
with the same ultimate limit on transactions.</li></ul><p>BUT</p><ul><li><strong>Reduced Security</strong>: L2 side-chains tend to be less decentralized,
with less security. (To the point that some get hacked.)</li></ul><p>Depending on their validation strategy,
L2 side-chains have additional limitations:</p><ul><li><p><em>Centralization</em>: Some L2 side-chains are plain centralized,
and can scale better than others,
but lose most of the security properties of blockchains,
reintroducing third-party risk.</p></li><li><p><em>Economic Validation</em>: Some L2 side-chains (such as Polygon)
use the very same economic validation technique as L1 blockchains
such as Proof-of-Stake, except with less capital involved,
which makes them a bit less secure.
Such side-chains can be viewed as just another L1 blockchain
with a builtin bridge to another L1.
The bridge itself is often the weakest link.</p></li><li><p><em>Interactive Validation</em>: Some L2 side-chains (such as Optimism)
use interactive proofs to ensure that transactions are valid.
We introduced this technique
in a <a href="https://bit.ly/FaCTS">previous whitepaper</a>
but no current implementation seems to have fully implemented it so far.
The technique also requires publishing data either
on a “data availability engine” such as Celestia
which introduces additional trust issues, or
on the L1 chain itself (in what is then called a “rollup”)
with associated scalability limitations.</p></li><li><p><em>Non-Interactive Validation</em>: Some L2 side-chains (such as Metis)
instead use non-interactive proofs (zk-SNARKs)
to ensure that transactions are valid.
These chains are much easier and faster to use, but
due to the current cost of building those proofs,
the proof-building itself is often centralized,
which reintroduces third-party risk.
Moreover, these side-chains have the same data availability issues
as those using interactive proofs.</p></li></ul><h3>Layer 2 State Channels</h3><p>State Channels, as introduced by the Bitcoin Lightning Network
and its many copycats, are a completely different “L2” approach.
They provide a safer solution with different limitations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: State Channels allow L2 payments to scale indefinitely.
L2 payments can be confirmed in a fraction of a second with no fees
and no limits on the number or size of payments.
State channels themselves are created and settled through L1 transactions
with the usual scaling limitations, but each state channel would typically
only need to be settled once per month,
significantly reducing the demand for L1 transactions compared to direct
blockchain payments without state channels.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy:</strong> State Channel payments are fully private—only participants
know about individual transactions, and
the public can only see channel creations and settlements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong>: State Channel funds are self-custodial, so
each participant’s funds are safe at all times with no third party risk
and no reduction in security compared to using the L1 Blockchain.
The worst that can happen is a participant’s funds
may be temporarily locked during some challenge period (typically one week)
if another participant stops cooperating, requiring the participants
to force an “exit” from the state channel.
The uncooperative participant is then blacklisted from future interactions
unless they pay some reparation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network Payments</strong>: State Channels allow for atomic cascaded payments
along a path of state channels (A pays B who pays C who pays D, etc.).
Paths can be established between participants who already know each other,
or can be automatically discovered along a Decentralized Network.
Payments remain scalable and private.</p></li></ul><p>BUT,</p><ul><li><p><strong>Only Funds under Custody</strong>: Each State Channel can only manipulate funds
under its custody, as deposited using regular L1 transactions.
That’s what makes them safe.</p></li><li><p><strong>One Way or the Server Way</strong>: Simply sending payments requires only
a one-way state channel and little to no tech expertise. But
a participant who wants to receive payments
or interact with a two-way State Channel,
must entrust a server with a “hot wallet” and keep the server online,
monitoring the L1 blockchain regularly (typically at least once a week)
or else funds may be lost.
This is fine for many businesses and for crypto enthusiasts, but
more effort than most users want to commit. Another safe attitude is
to always make an L1 settlement before you go offline
for a prolonged period of time after receiving funds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Only One Chain</strong>: Existing State Channels only function
on a single blockchain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Only One Token</strong>: Existing State Channels only support exchanging
a single (kind of) token on a given state channel—only bitcoins,
only ethers, only a specific ERC20, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Payments Only</strong>: Existing State Channels do not support smart contracts.
A few systems support them in theory, but they are unusable in practice
because they require manually writing every contract multiple times
in multiple languages wherein any discrepancy can cause a loss of assets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Two Participants Only</strong>: Existing State Channels only support
two participants in a given state channel.
Given that these existing state channels are already limited
to “Payments Only”, this is not a big additional limitation,
as adding more participants may allow
somewhat more efficient utilization of capital but
still wouldn’t otherwise enable new applications.</p></li></ul><h2><em>Chenilles</em>: Next Generation State Channels with Unique Capabilities</h2><p>We propose a next generation State Channel Network, <em>Chenilles</em>,
that can lift all the limitations about State Channels,
except for the one that makes them safe:
each channel is limited to the assets locked in the channel
and cannot be used to spend tokens not in its trust.</p><p><em>Chenilles</em> has all the upsides of existing State Channel networks,
starting with the Bitcoin Lightning Network, as described above:
<strong>Scalability</strong> (and therefore <strong>Affordability</strong>),
<strong>Privacy</strong>, <strong>Security</strong> and <strong>Network Payments</strong>.
It also shares two essential limitations of State Channels:
<strong>Only Funds under Custody</strong>, and <strong>One Way or the Server Way</strong>.
However, it lifts away the limitations of
<em>Only One Chain</em>, <em>Only One Token</em>, <em>Payments Only</em> and <em>Two Participants Only</em>.
Instead, <em>Chenilles</em> is
<a href="#Multi-Chain"><strong>Multi-Chain</strong></a>,
<a href="#Multi-Token"><strong>Multi-Token</strong></a>, and
<a href="#Multi-Participant"><strong>Multi-Participant</strong></a>
all thanks to enabling <strong>Smart Contracts</strong> in addition to Payments.
It also supports <strong>Improved Privacy with Hidden Channels</strong>, and
<strong>Further Improved Privacy with zk-SNARKs</strong>.
Finally, it supports <strong>Nestability</strong>, and
some more <strong>Advanced Smart Contracts</strong>.</p><p>The rest of this section explains in more detail
these superior features of <em>Chenilles</em> over existing State Channel networks.
You can skip to the next section
[Applications enabled by <em>Chenilles</em>](#Applications enabled by <em>Chenilles</em>)
if you’re only interested in the applications that these features make possible.</p><h3>Smart Contracts using <em>Glow</em></h3><p>Unlike existing State Channel networks,
<em>Chenilles</em> supports arbitrary smart contracts.</p><p>Some existing State Channel networks allow for
some form of smart contracts between participants in theory,
but they have limitations that make this feature unusable in practice:
writing a smart contract on these systems requires the author to write
the exact same contract in two or more completely different languages,
such as Solidity for the on-chain code on the one hand, and
Go and/or JavaScript for off-chain code on the other hand.
Any single discrepancy between those versions,
as well as any bug in any of them, puts all assets at risk.
Moreover, the on-chain code is not used during normal operations;
rather, it is only used in exceptional situations,
with each situation only exercising a small part of the code;
this requires careful design and systematic testing
quite unlike any code that anyone usually writes or tests.
All these constraints place an extremely low ceiling
on how complex applications can feasably be.</p><p>Our <em>Chenilles</em> system lifts this limitation thanks to its integration with
our programming language <em>Glow</em>:
<em>Glow</em> allows programmers to write a decentralized application (DApp)
as a single specification in a high-level language, from which the compiler
can simultaneously generate both on-chain and off-chain code.
<em>Glow</em> is also uniquely designed to facilitate the use of formal methods
and eliminate entire classes of complexity and vulnerabilities
usually required in smart contracts.</p><p>This unique smart contract capability enables <em>Chenilles</em>
to unlock a host of other capabilities—making them either possible at all,
or useful when they wouldn’t have been.</p><p>Note that practitioners of existing languages other than <em>Glow</em> can still
use the languages they are familiar with on the blockchains they support
to program DApps on top of Chenilles.
For instance, <em>Chenilles</em> on Ethereum can be programmed in Solidity;
<em>Chenilles</em> on Cardano can be programmed in Plutus;
<em>Chenilles</em> on MINA can be programmed in SnarkyJS; etc.
However, programming State Channels requires a different enough to
the “native” style</p><h3>Multi-Token</h3><p>Unlike existing State Channel networks, <em>Chenilles</em> supports
multiple token classes in a single state channel,
both fungible and non-fungible:
Ether, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, including wrapped BTC, stable coins, and NFTs.</p><p>Because other systems only support payments, they would not be able
to do anything with multiple tokens in a single state channel
that they could not do with multiple simpler state channels
each holding a single token.
But because <em>Chenilles</em> supports smart contracts, it can be used
to write atomic swaps, futures, exchanges using rates provided by oracles,
and all kinds of transactions that make it useful for a state channel
to hold multiple tokens at the same time.</p><p>Thanks to such contracts, <em>Chenilles</em> can also handle Network Payments where
one party pays in one kind of token,
the other party receives another kind of token.
A private contract enables a participant to lock an exchange rate
and protect themselves against the “implicit option” issue
with cross-currency payments, wherein the other participant
will have deposited suitable collateral.</p><h3>Multi-Chain</h3><p>Unlike existing State Channel networks,
<em>Chenilles</em> supports multiple blockchains at once.
Not only that, it allows for cross-chain transactions.</p><p><em>Chenilles</em> allows for Network Payments between Ethereum and Bitcoin, and
potentially between any two blockchains capable of supporting State Channels.
<em>Chenilles</em> can also be made to interoperate
with the Bitcoin Lightning Network itself,
leveraging all its existing liquidity, as well as
with any existing State Channel Network of interest.</p><p><em>Chenilles</em> can transfer tokens that are wrapped on another blockchain
by a Bridge, such as trading WBTC on Ethereum,
at one end of a Network Payment involving BTC on the other end.
But <em>Chenilles</em> can also transfer tokens without a bridge,
using private swap contracts, so users don’t have to trust
the security of a Bridge to enable payments across networks.</p><h3>Multi-Participant</h3><p>Unlike existing State Channel networks,
<em>Chenilles</em> allows more than two participants in a single State Channel.
This feature not only allows for more efficient use of capital,
but also allows for many new kinds of private contracts
between more than two participants.</p><p>Existing state channel networks, that only support payments,
would only be able to support multiple participants in a state channel
as a way to ensure slightly more efficient use of capital,
at the cost of extra complexity.
But since <em>Chenilles</em> allows for smart contracts, it is also possible
for multiple participants to conduct more elaborate interactions:
private auctions, multi-party swaps with many tokens,
oracles and bridges, direct NFT trades, etc.</p><p>Note that multi-participant state channels should only be used by
professionals or dedicated amateurs, who can trust themselves and each other
to maintain servers that are always available online,
so the capital doesn’t end up locked for the duration of an exit challenge.
Casual users should stick to one-way two-participant channels
with professionals on the other side.</p><h3>Improved Privacy with Hidden Channels</h3><p>Unlike existing State Channel networks,
<em>Chenilles</em> supports hiding channels behind a regular UTXO,
such that no outside party needs to even know
that a State Channel is being used.</p><p><em>Chenilles</em> by default will secure the assets of a state channel
into a regular address or UTXO, controlled by a regular ECDSA signature,
indistinguishable from any other regular address.
The participants will use an interactive multisig protocol
to control this address, and will pre-sign transactions using this address
as part of the <em>Chenilles</em> protocol.
Only in cases of non-cooperative exit and challenge will assets be put
under the control of a conspicuous state channel contract,
by using one of those pre-signed transactions.
As long as the participants cooperate in settling the state channel,
the result will look like a regular transaction.</p><p>On blockchains like Ethereum with an Account Model, <em>Chenilles</em> will provide
a contract implementing the UTXO model.
Outsiders can then see that a transaction is using the <em>Chenilles</em> contract,
but can’t tell if it is being used for a state channel,
or merely for the efficiency or privacy advantages of the UTXO model.</p><h3>Further Improved Privacy with zk-SNARKs</h3><p>Unlike existing State Channel networks,
<em>Chenilles</em> supports hiding payment conditions behind zk-SNARKs.
Information is shared on a need-to-know basis, and both parties
involved in a transaction must consent to the rules of the interaction.</p><p><em>Chenilles</em> can use <em>Glow</em>’s zk-SNARK backend to compile any contract
to a condition that is completely opaque to third parties.
In case one participant becomes uncooperative, the other participants can then
exit the state channel after a challenge period
without revealing the details of their dealings.
There are legitimate reasons why a participant may become uncooperative:
technical difficulties, successful attack on their infrastructure,
disease, death, war, etc.</p><p>Since these are private contracts, the cheaper kind of zk-SNARKs
that rely on trusted setup can be used—wherein the participants
run the setup off-chain between each other
before they start the on-chain interaction.
Even these zk-SNARKs remain relatively expensive on Ethereum,
so such enhanced privacy will come at a premium
compared to revealing payment conditions.
Note that either way, the price paid in either extra gas or loss of privacy
is only paid if one party stops cooperating:
the normal scenario is for all participants to keep cooperating
until the state channel is fully settled and no assets are left in it,
at which point no payment condition is revealed, zk-SNARK or not.</p><h3>Nestability</h3><p>Unlike existing State Channel Networks,
<em>Chenilles</em> allows for nested state channels:
a given state channel can be split into multiple sub-channels,
such that multiple conditional payments or contract transactions
can take place at the same time.</p><p>Existing State Channel Networks can do only one thing at a time.
If one participant along a payment path stops cooperating,
all the state channels along the path are blocked until
the others complete an exit including a challenge period (typically week-long).
<em>Chenilles</em> can split a state channel into multiple sub-state-channels,
such that failure to cooperate along a payment path
only affects the liquidity involved in the transactions lacking cooperation,
but do not affect the rest of the state channel.
In particular, splitting a sub-state channel from a state channel
doesn’t require any L1 transaction unless a participant stops cooperating.</p><p>Thus, a <em>Chenilles</em> state channel participant can be waiting
for another participant to act on one transaction,
yet still make progress on further ongoing transactions
with the same participant or a different one.
Participants may rely on conditions to be fulfilled, and
still accept transactions on other topics
with the same participant or other participants.
In particular, one channel can be blocked during a payment along a path,
yet the other channels along that path won’t be blocked from making progress
while waiting for that channel to make progress.</p><h3>Advanced Smart Contracts</h3><p>Unlike existing State Channel networks,
<em>Chenilles</em> supports smart contracts that interact with the blockchain
and with other state channel contracts.</p><p>Existing state channel networks, when they allow for smart contracts at all,
do not allow for those smart contracts to interact with other state channels,
with other smart contracts on the blockchain, including oracles, bridges,
automated market makers, exchanges, auctions, futures, insurances, etc.</p><p><em>Chenilles</em> allows smart contracts to use
information published on the underlying blockchain,
or on other suitably bridged systems:</p><ul><li><p>A payment can be committed based on publishing some secret with
a much shorter window than the exit challenge period of the state
channel—making it possible to confirm a transaction
within hours, minutes or seconds,
depending on readiness to spend extra gas for early confirmation, and/or
on a mutual trust in adequate data availability providers.
Even though it will take a week for the payment to fully settle,
the payment or non-payment will be confirmed early,
despite a participant having stopped to cooperate
(if he does cooperate, confirmation can be always achieved within a second or so).</p></li><li><p>A public auction can be conducted on the basis of
conditional state channel transactions based on
publishing a code identifying the winner, wherein
only participants can see the auction, participants cannot see each other,
and on-chain fees are much reduced.</p></li><li><p>A futures contract can use a historical price oracle
provided either off-chain (via a signed message) or
on-chain (via consulting an on-chain contract).
The futures contract could even use a complex formula
with integrals and derivatives that is checked by a decentralized
execution platform such as TrueBit, Fluence, Dfinity, etc.—or
verified using a zk-SNARK.</p></li></ul><p><em>Chenilles</em> contracts can take place along a path of state channels:</p><ul><li><p>Each participant leaves enough collateral
on each state channel along a path to each other participant, such that
whichever way the contract interaction goes the other participant is safe.
Collateral amounts are negotiated by participants off-chain
to make sure everyone is suitably incentivized to complete their part
of the interaction even if exchange rates change—as
long as volatility doesn’t explode beyond mutually anticipated limits
during the execution window.</p></li><li><p>A master contract on a blockchain that supports smart contracts
(e.g. Ethereum) computes the amounts owed
by each participant to each other participant.</p></li><li><p>Participants then either complete their side of the transaction or lose
their collateral that is then used to compensate the other participants.</p></li><li><p>Once all participants completed their side of the deal, the master contract
releases the collaterals back to the respective participants.
If some participants fail to do their part, then after a suitable timeout,
the other participants can claim the collateral of the former.</p></li><li><p>In a normal execution, all transactions happen via state channels
in a matter of seconds. If one participant fails,
the other participants may find themselves holding
the failing participant’s collateral on a different blockchain, and
have to use another <em>Chenilles</em> transfer or an exchange
to receive the value in the token they care about.</p></li><li><p>By using <em>Chenilles</em> as an intermediary on Ethereum
(or another blockchain with smart contracts), one could thus
connect state channels on Bitcoin and Monero
(both of which lack suitable smart contracts) and execute contracts
that involve the exchange of BTC and XMR according to
any smart contract conditions that can be specified using <em>Glow</em>.</p></li></ul><h2>Applications enabled by <em>Chenilles</em></h2><p><em>Chenilles</em> enables all the applications that State Channels do.
But <em>Chenilles</em> also enables many kinds of applications
that are not affordably possible with existing technologies,
State Channels or not.
This vastly increases the potential value of the network
compared to existing state channel networks.</p><h3>Payments with automatic currency conversion</h3><p><em>Chenilles</em> enables payment of transaction wherein</p><ul><li><p>a price is agreed upon in any generally accepted reference currency, yet</p></li><li><p>the customer pays in whichever currency they want to hold
(whether crypto-native token or fiat-indexed stablecoin), and</p></li><li><p>the merchant receives whichever currency they want to hold, and</p></li><li><p>some intermediaries are automatically found who will offer the best rate
after accounting for fees and the customer’s and merchant’s assessment of
execution risk (which risk is limited to the possible state channel failure
and consequent delay, and never puts the main assets at stake).</p></li></ul><p>By decoupling these three currencies,
<em>Chenilles</em> enables individuals and businesses to each keep their accounting
in whichever currencies they must legally or contractually use,
yet each hold assets in the currencies they believe will best hold value.</p><h3>Micropayments for metered decentralized utilities</h3><p>State Channels make it possible for users to automatically pay small amounts
for small services based on a metering of how much services they use.
Decentralized services can then be provided wherein users pay by volume,
get serviced on a commodity market
by interchangeable providers who watch each other.
Users and providers don’t have to build mutual trust relationships,
instead only having to trust the overall network.</p><p>This automated decentralized intermediation can be used to pay
for any service that can be verifiably provided over the Internet,
including but not limited to:
storage, search, computation, advertisement, gaming, etc.
Companies and individuals can then sell the “spare cycles” of their hardware,
optimizing global resource utilization.
In the future, even physical utility providers could also be paid this way
for electricity, water, telecommunications, etc.,
to enjoy the improved efficiency.</p><p>Indeed “pay as you go” pricing can be more economically efficient
than either “pay before” or “pay after”:
As compared to users pre-paying for services,
micropayments ensure that users don’t end up with
an unused balance that they forfeit.
As compared with users paying for services after the fact,
micropayments ensure that providers are not left with unpaid bills
by indelicate users that are expensive to go after.
Metering also allows for a fair payment of resources
shared between a lot of users.
Finally, the lack of any ongoing balance either way means that
users and providers do not have to build and maintain
a long-term trust relationship;
thus there is a low barrier to entry to become either user or provider;
no need for burdensome identification forms or vast capitals
to immobilize as collateral, or expensive reputation to maintain;
just put down in a state channel some amount sufficient to cover service usage,
and use a smart contract to ensure payment goes with service rendered.</p><p>Of course, users and providers do not have to manually approve each micropayment
for each fraction of a cent—the expense in time and mental attention
would cost more than the transactions are worth.
Instead, users would set soft and hard limits in their user interfaces
to be aware of their utility bills and be able to control their expenses
without getting bad surprises, but would otherwise let their software
handle the payments automatically without user interaction.</p><h3>Decentralized Banking</h3><p>A salaryman or contractor can get paid once a month in a L1 transaction,
then make lots of small private payments
over the State Channel Network over the month.
The monthly transaction can also be used for the bank
to make a partial settlement with reduced fees.
A State Channel in the <em>Chenilles</em> Network then becomes a replacement for
a checking account with a debit card.</p><p><em>Chenilles</em> makes this scenario much more likely than the
Bitcoin Lightning Network, because
it supports holding currencies other than Bitcoin
(including fiat-indexed or fiat-backed stablecoins), and
payments to be made in any currency rather than only in Bitcoin.
Therefore <em>Chenilles</em> does not depend on the world having adopted Bitcoin
as a single currency to be useful, unlike the Bitcoin Lightning Network.</p><p>Note that this use case, where the bulk of L2 payments are one-way
from depositor to bank (and from there to other people), while
any significant deposits to the depositor are on L1,
remains safe even for depositors whose computer do not to connect
to the Network every week: indeed, since deposits are on L1,
the only intermediate L2 transactions that the bank may successfully roll back
if it tries are those in its favor.
In the odd event that a depositor receives money via L2,
they have the choice of confirming the payment on L1 before they go offline,
if they are concerned about the bank trying to steal that amount.</p><h3>Private Smart Contracts</h3><p><em>Chenilles</em> enables network participants to bind each other
through arbitrary smart contracts,
in a way that is not only scalable, but completely private:
only participants can see that the transactions happen, and
non-participants cannot even see that any contract or state channel
exists at all and between whom.
Even in the fallback case when
a participant stops cooperating with the other(s),
the conditions attached to ongoing contracts
can be hidden behind a zk-SNARK:
whether it’s an atomic swap, a futures contract, a poker game, etc.</p><p>Private smart contracts can also rely on publicly available data
by checking that said data was signed by a suitable oracle committee,
or that the data has been included on the blockchain.
For instance, a public auction can be run through a series of
private conditional payments where the condition is that
the bidder is declared as the winner
by the seller publishing their mutually agreed random nonce as the winner.
No one but the seller needs to know who was the winner for how much—though
it is also possible to have the public contract enforce revelation
of that information, if desired,
e.g. by a clearinghouse listing the auction for a fee.</p><h2>Business Model For Chenilles LLC</h2><p>There are many ways for Chenilles LLC to monetize the <em>Chenilles</em> Network.</p><h3>Big Picture: A layer above blockchains</h3><p>First, let us make it clear that using or operating the <em>Chenilles</em> Network
does not require introducing a new token, and that this is a great advantage.</p><p>The <em>Chenilles</em> Network is blockchain-agnostic:
it can work with any blockchain that has scripts or contracts.
We are building a layer above existing and future blockchains and side-chains,
rather than yet another blockchain or side-chain.
We can thus connect these blockchains without being impeded
as a competitor, rival or enemy, instead being welcome
as a facilitator, a friend, a bringer of traffic.</p><p>Furthermore, by not requiring users to hold yet another coin and
instead letting them pay principal and fees in the coin of their own choosing,
<em>Chenilles</em> removes friction rather than increases it.
Thus, we are drastically reducing the barrier to transferring value
from one blockchain to the next, and
increasing competition between those chains based on
their financial fundamentals, effectively commoditizing them.</p><p>We are building an over-net that can
extract the value from the underlying blockchains,
just like the early Microsoft built a layer of languages and operating systems
above PC hardware, capturing the value of the PC market
while commoditizing the hardware manufacturers.</p><p>Now that this big picture has been drawn, here are specific revenue streams that it enables.</p><h3>Fees on Channel Creation</h3><p>The <em>Chenilles</em> Network is Open Source, and anyone could in theory
create their own fork of the <em>Chenilles</em> contract.
Yet by using the same contract as everyone else:</p><ol><li><p>Users can cheaply interact with the liquidity in the existing contract,
enjoying network effects.</p></li><li><p>Users don’t have to pay the high gas cost of creating
their own copy of the contract.</p></li><li><p>Users benefit from improved privacy by putting their assets
in a common pool of UTXO, which makes it harder for third parties
to identify who is transacting with whom.</p></li></ol><p>Therefore, there is a strong incentive for users to use the existing contract
rather than create their own fork.
We at Chenilles LLC can thus enjoy a first mover advantage and levy a small fee,
much smaller than the cost of creating a contract,
each time a user creates or settles a state channel, and
make money as the network grows in number of users.
On existing UTXO networks, such a contract isn’t needed, but
the default clients could still pay a small fee to a known address
upon channel creation, as long as this fee is smaller than
the cost of negotiating use of an alternative client
with the other state channel participant.</p><h3>Commissions on Network Payments</h3><p><em>Chenilles</em> will be the heart of a worldwide payment protocol
from any currency to any currency, including both crypto and fiat currencies,
with very low fees. There can even be state channels
for the “On Ramp” and “Off Ramp” parts of a payment—though these parts
will probably be centralized and require KYC.</p><p>Each of the liquidity providers along the path to a payment
can earn a small fee, and Chenilles LLC can earn a commission on those fees
by connecting users to liquidity providers. Even with those fees,
the network can be much cheaper than existing centralized payment networks.
And even though Chenilles LLC only gets a small commission on those small fees—we can
disrupt the market, displace the big players of today and
expand the already trillion dollar yearly transaction volume
by serving populations currently unbanked in the developing world.
Existing centralized systems can’t compete with our decentralized system
in terms of capital, trust and
time required to process and settle transactions.
They can use regulatory capture to exclude competition in the USA,
but there are plenty of countries where the legacy systems are so bad
that nothing will stop people from adopting a better alternative.</p><h3>Issuing Value Add Tokens</h3><p>The <em>Chenilles</em> Network, being based on self-custodial State Channels,
does not require, will never require, cannot require a new token to operate:
the entire point of it is to facilitate transactions
and reduce friction in using blockchain technology.
Any system that requires a new token to complete transactions
that were previously possible without that token,
by definition introduces friction, makes things worse,
and has a negative value proposition.</p><p>On the other hand, it is possible to valuably introduce tokens
to manage new kinds of transactions that are not possible
and were not previously possible without these tokens.
The <em>Chenilles</em> Network will enable new kinds of services
that can be provided with new tokens:</p><ol><li><p>A specialized Data Availability Engine can be used to achieve
faster confirmation of success or failure of path payments.
Such faster confirmation is especially useful in cases involving
currency swaps for which latency combined with volatility increases
transaction costs, so that
users are willing to pay extra to reduce latency.
Payment for the service will itself be done in any currency using
<em>Chenilles</em> State Channels.
But participation in the Engine's validation committee will itself
be done based on Proof-of-Stake using a new token that we will issue.
This would be a usual validation network utility token, though
what it validates isn't a blockchain as such and
the token may thus be hosted on an existing blockchain such as Ethereum
(or whichever makes the most sense at the time the token is launched).</p></li><li><p>Governance of the <em>Chenilles</em> Network, the distribution of its fees,
will be done by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
based on a governance token, that we will issue.
The DAO will elect a board, that will name a CEO and other officers,
who will manage the treasury constituted of the accumulated fees.
Based on this treasury, the management team will fund the
development and maintenant of the Network, and if applicable
determine how much of the remaining funds to distribute among token holders.
This DAO will then replace Chenilles LLC with respect to managing the Network;
Chenilles LLC would be dissolved and governance tokens would be distributed
to Chenilles LLC shareholders as proportional replacement for their shares.
This would be a usual network governance security token, also to be
hosted on an existing blockchain.</p></li><li><p>Incentives towards early adoption of the <em>Chenilles</em> Network,
its Fast Confirmation Engine, or its Maintenance DAO,
can be provided through yield farming to bootstrap the network effects.
This yield farming would involve new tokens,
distributed based on early Network activity, an Airdrop, and
other marketing actions destined to increase network activity and value.
Ownership of these yield farming tokens would eventually lead to rewards
based on shares of the Engine and/or DAO tokens reserved
for this marketing usage.</p></li></ol><p>MuKn would be uniquely positioned to issue these tokens
and make money selling them.</p><h3>Controlling the Default Client</h3><p>MuKn will control the default client
with which most users interact with <em>Chenilles</em>.
MuKn will then be able to connect developers and users
to liquidity providers and value-added services, and earn commissions.</p><p>Cryptocurrency users, who value privacy,
will presumably be willing to pay fees rather than be served ads.
But as we start reaching a broader audience, ads may become an option.
And even before then, we can place privileged partners higher
on the list of all potential providers offered to our users,
in exchange for higher commissions on transactions that use them.</p><h3>Decentralized Application Development</h3><p>We at MuKn are uniquely positioned to help others
write decentralized applications on top of <em>Chenilles</em>,
thanks to our expertise in <em>Chenilles</em>, and
especially thanks to expertise in our <em>Glow</em> language:</p><ul><li><p>Until <em>Glow</em> is widely adopted, mastering it is a <em>moat</em>
that gives us a clear advantage over our competition.</p></li><li><p>Once <em>Glow</em> is widely adopted,
being in effective control of its development will give MuKn
a lot of opportunities for monetization as we provide access
to all the services available through <em>Glow</em>.</p></li><li><p>Either way, our team can leverage its unique combination of expertise
in formal methods, crypto-economics, languages, distributed systems,
security and business, to build what other teams cannot
because they lack the synergy of simultaneously having experts
in each of these many domains.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, MuKn will be able to weave partnerships with all the first movers
by helping them develop their contracts, and there again,
earn money in fixed amount contracts, or profit shares, etc.</p><h3>Steering an Ecosystem</h3><p>As <em>Chenilles</em> and <em>Glow</em> get widespread adoption, we will not only enable
a new class of applications that were extremely costly to build before—we
will allow these applications to
interoperate, extend and complement each other.
MuKn will find itself at the helm of a thriving ecosystem
that brings together all decentralized applications on all blockchains.</p><p>Unlike existing projects, MuKn does not depend on the success of a new token.
We are not trying to create yet another blockchain
that would somehow become standard.
Quite the contrary, we are building a marketplace
that spans existing and future blockchains, abstracts them away,
and commoditizes them—just like Microsoft abstracted away the PC hardware
with its operating systems and commoditized the hardware vendors.
The possibilities are endless, and MuKn will be
the Microsoft of Decentralization, the King of anti-Monopoly.</p><h3>Bootstrapping the Business</h3><p>While we identified many potential revenue sources
for a business around the <em>Chenilles</em> Network,
getting the business off the ground will require prioritizing those activities
that at any moment maximize the return on investment
given the constraints of the available runway.
In the shorter term we will start with less capital-intensive activities,
and as we grow we can move to more capital-intensive in the long run:</p><ul><li><p>First, we will build private real-time decentralized settlement solutions
for large users of cryptocurrency, whether part of traditional Financial
Institutions, or newcomers specialized in Decentralized Finance.
This is a pure service offering.</p></li><li><p>Second, we will target DeFi enthusiasts who seek a non-custodial DEX,
and the liquidity providers who will sell them access. We will solve
their issue with having to choose between fast centralized exchanges
with counterparty risk, or the slowness of decentralized exchanges.</p></li><li><p>Third, we will target end-users who seek a reliable payment system that
can't censor, inflate or confiscate, offering a decentralized alternative
to traditional banking.</p></li><li><p>Along the way, and increasingly, we will create a platform for developers
to build DApps. Eventually, we will target these developers with products
and services that can enhance both their development experience and the
software they create on our platform.</p></li><li><p>Issuing tokens will be done at strategic moments that will maximize value.</p></li></ul><h2>Conclusion: Invest in the Future of DeFi and DeCo</h2><p>Mutual Knowledge Systems (MuKn) is building the <em>Chenilles</em> Network,
